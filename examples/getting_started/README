This directory contains a simple example to get started.
To create the Example-object run

	classgen example.txt Example.pm

from your command line. Example.pm will be created. To try
this class run try_example, best with the degugger:

	perl -d try_example

A more sophisticated example can be found at ../peanuts .

Enjoy.
