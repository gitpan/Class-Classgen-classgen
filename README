Classgen-3.02						(5/2000)


Simplifies creation, manipulation and usage of complex objects.

classgen is a script that allows you to create a Perl-object from
a simple control-file. In the control file you basically specify
the internal instance-variables this object should have. classgen
then generates ASCII-source code (package) for you, which contains:

	* a new() - method with the variables blessed to an {}
	* accessor- and manipulator-methods for all these variables
	* a specific() - method; it serves as a skelton for you to
	  edit further object-specific methods as you need them
	* a perldoc-skelton at the end


This way you can fully focus on what your object should be doing. No
need to bother around with instance-variables.

To install classgen 'gunzip' and 'tar xvf' the .gz file in a directory
of your choice. Next run from this directory:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install (as root)

There are a few examples in examples/ which include how to extend the 
generated object for inheritance from base-classes.

Hi, Michael,
 
Thanks for the wonderful "classgen" utility, it saves
me a lot of typing. (...)
